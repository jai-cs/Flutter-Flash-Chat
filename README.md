## Important Note: 

>This app was created by Jai Shah as part of the [Flutter Boot Camp course by London App Brewery](https://github.com/londonappbrewery/Flutter-Course-Resources/). None of the designs and ideas used are not mine and this was only a practise app created while learning. I have added a few visual changes of my own in this app.
